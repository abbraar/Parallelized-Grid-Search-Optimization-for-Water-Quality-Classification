# Parallelized-Grid-Search-Optimization-for-Water-Quality-Classification

In aquatic systems, water quality is an important indicator of overall health. Numerous adverse effects can result from poor water quality, both on human health and the surrounding environment. So, this dataset is about water quality metrics and how to classify water potability. We have 3276 samples and 10 features

X features:

1-ph: pH of 1. water (0 to 14).

2-Hardness: Capacity of water to precipitate soap in mg/L.

3-Solids: Total dissolved solids in ppm.

4-Chloramines: Amount of Chloramines in ppm.

5-Sulfate: Amount of Sulfates dissolved in mg/L.

6-Conductivity: Electrical conductivity of water in μS/cm.

7-Organic_carbon: Amount of organic carbon in ppm.

8-Trihalomethanes: Amount of Trihalomethanes in μg/L.

9-Turbidity: Measure of light emiting property of water in NTU.

Y feature:

10-Potability : Indicates if water is safe for human consumption where 1 means Potable and 0 means Not potable.
